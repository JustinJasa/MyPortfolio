## The Project:

The heart of my portfolio is a single-page application (SPA) built with Next.js, a powerful React framework that offers server-side rendering and generates a highly optimized production build. By opting for Next.js, I was able to leverage its seamless page routing and fast refresh features, ensuring a smooth user experience and easy navigation between different sections of my portfolio.

For the content management, I chose Sanity.io, a unified content platform that comes with a fully customizable editor and a hosted backend. Sanity.io allowed me to structure content as I saw fit, making it a breeze to update my portfolio with new projects, blog posts, and skills without needing to alter my front-end codebase.

## The Development Process:

My development process began with the design phase, where I focused on creating a responsive and accessible user interface that adapts to various screen sizes and devices. I implemented a mobile-first approach to ensure optimal usability and aesthetics from the smallest to the largest of screens.

With Next.js at the core, I was able to integrate Sanity.io seamlessly. I used Sanity's powerful querying language, GROQ, to fetch content, ensuring that the data displayed is always up-to-date and reflective of my latest work. I also took advantage of Next.jsâ€™s API routes to handle form submissions, like contact requests, directly on my server instance without requiring an external server.

The styling of the portfolio was accomplished with a combination of CSS Modules and Styled Components, which allowed for modular and reusable style snippets, keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.
